In this assignment, a predictive model to predict a churn target (customer retention setting) is created.

The **data set** consists of customer information of a Belgian bank-insurer for retail customers above 18 years old (i.e. not companies but individuals).   
Some data anonymization was applied to e.g. remove personally identifying information.   
The main goal of the data set is to predict which of the customers will churn.  
The target was constructed as follows:  
The main goal of this exercise was to construct a predictive model to predict churn (in short, customer who "leave").   

The available data files describe the customer base, randomly split (stratified) in a train and test part:
* **train_month_3_with_target.csv**: state of the applicable customer base at 2018-TT (the "current" point in time), with the target included (determined using 2018-(TT+4), 2018-(TT+5) and 2018-(TT+6) as described above)
* **train_month_2.csv**: state of the applicable customer base at 2018-(TT-1) (can be used for additional feature engineering; note that balance on account is stable compared to 2018-TT)
* **train_month_1.csv**: state of the applicable customer base at 2018-(TT-2) (can be used for additional feature engineering; note that balance on account is stable compared to 2018-TT)
	
* **test_month_3.csv**: state of the applicable customer base at 2018-TT for the test set customers
* **test_month_2.csv**: state of the applicable customer base at 2018-(TT-1) for the test set customers (can be used for additional feature engineering; note that balance on account is stable compared to 2018-TT)
* **test_month_1.csv**: state of the applicable customer base at 2018-(TT-2) for the test set customers (can be used for additional feature engineering; note that balance on account is stable compared to 2018-TT)
